#ASCII Spiral Generator

##What does this program do?
This program draws a square spiral consisting of asterisks based on the width specified.

##Why?
Because this challenge was assigned during one of my programming job interviews, and I couldn't come up with a solution in the allotted time. Naturally, after I finished the interview, I had to go back and figure out the problem.
